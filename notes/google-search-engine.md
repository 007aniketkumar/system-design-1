# Google Search Engine
These notes are on the Google prototype (1998) for the large-scale search engine.
## History
In 1998, Yahoo was the leading search engine. To have high quality indices, Yahoo used a manual approach to do so. Popular topics were subjective, expensive to build, slow to update, and did not cover obscure topics. 

Automated search engines returned low quality matches. Advertisers were able to game the system to mislead these engines. Users were accustomed to having to look through at least ten results to find at least one relevent result.
## Design Goals
1. **Web Scale.** At the rate the Web was growing, fast crawling is required to be able to process hundreds of gigabytes efficiently. Search queries should have low latency at a throughput of thousands of queries per second.
1. **Search Quality**. Users want to see only the most relevant results.
1. **Academic Research**. Current search engines catered to commercial entities and advertisers. Researchers need a means to process large portions of the Web to produce meaningful, academic results.
